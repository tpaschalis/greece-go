## Submissions

To submit please open a pull request or send me a tweet (twitter.com/tpaschalis_) with the following info:

- company name and what the product is/the company does
- size of the company in general (ballpark number of people in engineering, number of teams/engineers in Greece that use Go) etc.
- what the teams that use Go for? backend/web, open source, systems level programming, etc.

The idea is to get a sense of how widespread is the use of Go throughout your organization; is everyone using it or just a 
small handful of developers? Should someone who wants to work mostly in Go be happy at your company?

Don't hesitate to send if you work for a remote friendly company that employ Go developers in Greece who either meet and work in person regularly or share a coworking space together.
